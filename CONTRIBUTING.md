# Contributing

We welcome contributions aligned with our purpose: building high-quality, AI-assisted software questions and prompts.

## Ground Rules
- All contributions must be your own original work.
- Submitting a PR means you agree to license your contribution under the [Apache 2.0 License](LICENSE).
- PRs must include a clear purpose, rationale, and pass all checks.
- Write clean, Spartan code and documentationâ€”clarity over cleverness.

## How to Contribute

2. Create a new branch: `feature/<name>` or `doc/<name>`.
3. Submit a PR with a clear title and description.
4. Expect review within 48 hours. We may request changes or clarifications.

## Code Style
- Use linting and formatting tools.
- Be explicit with logic, especially in AI prompt phrasing.

## Security
If you find a security vulnerability, please report it via email (not a GitHub issue).
