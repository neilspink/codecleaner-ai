# ai-code-surgeon

**Purpose**: Help developers and security leaders interrogate code with sharp, AI-powered questions. Drive secure, clean, high-impact software—no fluff.

## How It Works
1. Pick a question (e.g., “Any code here OWASP would classify as risky?”).
2. Drop in code snippet.
3. AI reviews with domain-aligned rigor: security, maintainability, clarity, cost.

## Core Question Types
- Security (OWASP, injection, data exposure)
- sign clarity (anti-patterns, smell)
- Cost/tech debt tradeoffs (complexity vs ROI)
- Architecture alignment (SRP, DRY, etc.)

## Example Prompt
```bash
"Any code here that OWASP would classify as risky?"
